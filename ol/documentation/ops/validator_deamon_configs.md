# Running 0L validator as a system service
This guide will create a daemon service which runs a `diem-node` and restarts on failure and on reboot. 

Note that this guide:
- targets Ubuntu 20.4.
- assumes you have set up your environment correctly (see util/setup.sh).
- does not provision the `tower` service which is a separate concern from `diem-node`.

# Background
`systemd`, is a linux utility for managing long-running services on linux. The validation service (`diem-node`) is one such long running service. The `tower` is another, but that is out of scope for this doc.

There are a few file paths you will be working from:

- `~/.0L/` will contain the node configurations
- `~/<project root>/diem-node`: contains the source code
- `~/<project root>/target/release`: will contain binaries produced by cargo

# Quick Start

This will use a `make` recipe to start the node daemon and install the daemon configs.

First. Copy a template for systemd from `<project root>/ol/util/diem-node.service` into your 0L home path, usually `~/.0L`. This is non-root template file needs to be edited: replace occurrences of `<<YOUR USERNAME!>>` with the username under which the service will run.

BEFORE PROCEEDING: Check you have `~/.0L/diem-node.service` in place and edited with your usename.

Now the Makefile can do a number of things including coping that file to the usual place, and then (re)starting the service.

From the project root:

`make daemon`

# Slow Start

## Build binaries and copy to appropriate path
Use `make bins install` or alternatively:


## Create the service configurations for Systemd
In `~/.config/systemd/user/` you should create a file like this. (Note: again, `make daemon` does this for you)

```
# edit this document and replace <<YOUR USERNAME!>> with your linux user
[Unit]
Description=0L Node Service

[Service]
LimitNOFILE=20000
WorkingDirectory=/home/node/.0L
ExecStart=/home/node/bin/diem-node --config /home/node/.0L/validator.node.yaml

Restart=always
RestartSec=10s

# Make sure you CREATE the directory and file for your node.log
StandardOutput=file:/home/node/logs/node.log
StandardError=file:/home/node/logs/node.log

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Alias=diem-node.service

```
### NOTE: When you update any `*service` file, you must reload `ststemctl`
`systemctl daemon-reload`


# Shortcuts 

### Watch diem-node logs

You can follow the logs by simply tailing the logs file.

`tail -f ~/logs/node.log`

### Start the new service
`make daemon` or manually:

`systemctl start diem-node.service`

### Stop the new service
`make stop` or manually:

`systemctl stop diem-node.service`

### Enable the new service to start on boot
`systemctl enable diem-node.service`

### Check status of the new service
`systemctl status diem-node.service`

if you have been successful when you run you will see:
```
● diem-node.service - OL Node Service
   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/diem-node.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Tue 2020-06-23 16:06:38 UTC; 10min ago
 Main PID: 15499 (diem-node)
    Tasks: 1 (limit: 4915)
   CGroup: /system.slice/diem-node.service
           └─15499 /usr/local/bin/diem-node --config /root/.0L/node.yaml
```

### Set up proper logging

Logs are being written to a flat file. This is not ideal. You may want to configure `journalctl`.

# Trouble shooting
## Validator Wizard

If your config files have not been created you'll need to do onboarding. Check if you have a  ~/.0L/0L.toml file. This is a sign that you are not yet onboarded.
